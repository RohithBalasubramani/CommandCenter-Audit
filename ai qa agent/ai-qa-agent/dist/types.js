/**
 * Type definitions for the AI QA Agent - a general-purpose web testing agent.
 *
 * This agent acts like ChatGPT agent mode / Claude computer-use —
 * it sees the browser, decides what to click/type, and autonomously
 * tests any web application like a human test engineer would.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic: works with React, Vue, Angular, plain HTML, etc.
